//map() creates a new array populated  with the results of calling aprovided function on every element in the calling array

let numbers  = [1, 3, 4, 5, 2, 5]

let double = numbers.map(num => num * 2)
console.log(double);

//difference between forEach and map
//map method modifies an array and returns into a new variable array
//forEach performs function on each element, but doesn't return anything
