//Set is a built-in data structure introduced in ES6 that represents a collention
//of unique values. Unlike arrats, Set allows you to stoe only unique values.
//which means duplicate values are automatically removed. Each value can occur ONCE


//Set objects are useful when you need to store a list of unique elements and quickly 
//check for the existence of a specific value.
